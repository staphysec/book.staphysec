* [droopescan](https://github.com/droope/droopescan), a plugin-based scanner that works for SilverStripe, WordPress, and Drupal with limited functionality for Joomla and Moodle.
* &#x20;[JoomlaScan](https://github.com/drego85/JoomlaScan), which is a Python tool inspired by the now-defunct OWASP [joomscan](https://github.com/OWASP/joomscan) tool. `JoomlaScan` is a bit out-of-date and requires Python2.7 to run.
